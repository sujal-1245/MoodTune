# MoodTune - AI Mood Detection & Song Recommendation ðŸŽµ

## Overview
MoodTune is an AI-powered web application that detects the mood from a user-uploaded image and recommends a song based on the detected emotion. The application uses machine learning to analyze the image, determine the mood, and then provides a music playlist tailored to the user's emotional state. 

## Features
* **Mood Detection**: Uses AI to analyze facial expressions and detect the user's mood from an uploaded photo.
* **Song Recommendation**: Based on the detected emotion, a song is recommended to match the mood.
* **Simple UI**: Clean and minimal interface with a smooth user experience.
